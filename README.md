Project Overview
The content listing page consists of a page title and a three-column vertically scrolling grid.
The grid displays content items with poster images and titles.
The design is adapted for iOS device form factors based on the provided Redlines, with adjustments made as necessary.
Image assets from the Slices folder are used for the content items.
Data for the page, including titles and poster images, is fetched from the provided JSON files in the API folder. Lazy loading is implemented to load additional data as the user scrolls down the page seamlessly.
Special Considerations
Edge cases for two content items on Page 3 are handled creatively without breaking UI consistency.
Usability and design consistency with the provided Redlines are prioritized.
UI components and frameworks are chosen for both speed of development and performance.
